# .zshenv: read for all new shells
#
# From `man zsh`:
#
# Commands  are  first  read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden.
# [...]
# Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv.  If the shell is a  login
# shell,  commands  are  read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zpro-
# file.  Then, if the  shell  is  interactive,  commands  are  read  from
# /etc/zshrc  and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc.  Finally, if the shell is a login
# shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.
